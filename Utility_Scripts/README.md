## 3 Utility scripts I used pretty often.

1. File Upload Script: Allows you to upload a file to a file sharing service "0x0.st" and instantly returns the generated url for easy file sharing.
2. A torrent downloader that makes a request to "1337x.to" with a specific file name, allows you to select the available file's and instantly downloads them to the specified folder.
3. Rename script: Simple script that I used to easily change image file extensions to jpg.
